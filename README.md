# python-challenge
This is a repository with my first experiences using Python.

In the PyBank folder, I used the financial dataset called budget_data.csv with columns "Date" and "Profit/Losses". I looked into the number of months in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses", the average changes of those pofits/losses, and the greatest increase and decrease of those profits over the entire period.
I utilized skills of utilizing a CSV file, basic math functions in python as well as list comprehension, and dictionary. Finally, I formatted the output in the terminal and a new .txt file to match the image of the results from the assignment.
In the PyPoll folder, I used the dataset called election_data.csv with coloumns "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I imported the Counter collection. I went through the document as a list and used different elements in the list to calculate the votes cast, display the names of the candidates who received votes, their percentage of votes as well as the number of votes per candidate. I then added in a loop to check for the winner. Finally, I printed the information to the terminal and a .txt file to display the output aligned with the assignment results.

On the both portions of this challenge, I utlized help and portions of code from my tutor, Anna Poulakos (software engineer) and Stack Overflow.
